                <!-- about you -->
                <p>I am a currently a second-year systems and computing engineering student at the University of Guelph. I have always had an interest in how different components come together to create on big end result. I grew up continuously asking the same questions; “how does this work?” followed up by “why?”. I became fascinated with electronics like computers during the beginning of my high school career. After the first day of my tech class, I felt completely clueless. Afterwards, I came home and bombarded my dad with a bunch of questions until he decided to take apart an old computer with me. He explained all the components and how they play an important role in operating a computer system. After this I continued to take technical classes and chose to pursue an engineering degree. 
                </p> <p> <br> Now, I enjoy working on technical group projects where I can problem solve and collaborate with fellow students. During my spare time, I play tennis with the university team to improve my mental toughness and watch ‘How It’s Made’ videos to give me new ideas that I can contribute to group projects. </p>
