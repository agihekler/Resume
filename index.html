                </p>   <b>File Processing (2023):</b> </br>I completed this project in the second semester of my first year as a major assignment in my Object Oriented programming class. It was programmed in Java in NetBeans environment to meet the task assigned by the Laserfiche company.  
            </br>In this team-based project, the objective was to sort local and remote storage elements by extracting them from given file paths, then processing them depending on the required processing scenarios. My main role was to create some of the processing elements, primarily the print and split methods. The goal of the print method was to print out all the given storage elements from an array after processing. In the split function all the data from a file was read into an array and split into equal parts. These parts then needed to be renamed and added to separate files each with individual file paths, so they could be processed further if required. Since this was a team project, weekly meeting were held to discuss progress and work through any problems faced as a group. The final task was then to present the functionality of the project in lab.

                </p> <b>GPS Position Calculator (2022):</b> </br>This was one of the two major projects completed in my first C programming course in the first year. The objective of this assignment was to work with a partner on the creation of a program which will calculate the closest person to the inputted target. The user was given the option to either read from a file of given persons or input all the comparators along with the target. The relative closest user was calculated using a distance equation with the positions represented in terms of latitude, longitude and altitude. This project required a presentation of the code along with a detailed report following the design and planning process.
            </br>
        </br>
        
                </p> <b>Engineering Design Project (2022):</b> </br>This was a semester long major design project in my first year. I collaborated in a team of engineering students to design and build and autonomous vehicle called a teddy bear wheelchair. The objective was to have a teddy bear secured safely in the vehicle while completing an obstacle course. The vehicle was build using a Meccano kit, electrical kit and other resources such as cardboard, popsicle sticks etc., along with a 3D printed launcher. The start of the design involved creating a rolling chassis and then connecting the electrical components. The vehicle was controlled by two electric motors connected through a breadboard with additional connections to an Arduino. The Arduino was programmed to control the forward and backward rotation of the motors as well as the launching mechanism (making it autonomous). The vehicle was mechanically designed in SolidWorks; an assembly instruction drawing was also created containing an  exploded view detailing all subassemblies and parts of the top level mechanism. The rolling chassis and the electrical circuit was drawn in AutoCAD.  
            </br>For this project my main roles included working on the chassis, mechanically modeling the vehicle, uploading and debugging the Arduino code and testing/troubleshooting the functionality of the design. I also organized the weekly team meetings and assigned tasks to the group. For this project the functionality needed to be presented along with the completion of a detailed report. This report contained elements such as a cost analysis, emission summary, centre of mass calculation and overall performance analysis. 
            </br>
        </br>
                </p> <b>Photo Mosaic Project (2022):</b>  </br> In my grade 12 Computer Science class we were given the opportunity to complete a personal 3 month final project. For my project I decided to create a photo mosaic programmed in Python in a VS code environment. The photo mosaic was created by dividing up a base photo into pixels which would be replaced by other photos. The replacement photos were stored in a folder which were all read in and resized to the given pixel size. The colour and saturation of the photos were compared to the pixels in the base photo and replace accordingly, creating a mosaic. For the resizing and comparing of photos the cv2, glob and PIL python libraries were used.

                <b>Engineering Big Buddy</b>
                <br><i>University of Guelph | Sept 2023</i>
                <br>I volunteered as an orientation leader for the September 2023 incoming engineering students. Here, I guided students around campus, while engaging them in welcoming events such as the welcome march, karaoke night and beach day. These events ran for a week. First year students were able to ask the orientation leaders questions about the engineering program and gain connections in preparation of the start of the University year. During this event, I gained valuable leadership and communication skills.

                    <br>This is my second year as a member of the university of Guelph tennis team. Currently, I am the women's team co-captain. We have team practices twice a week and have tournaments twice a month against neighbouring universities. I help run communication on the women's end by collecting merch orders and availability for tournaments. I also participate in coaches meetings with the men's team captain and our coach to discuss any changes to practice times or tournament dates, etc. This role has helped me showcase leadership and sportsmanship while promoting a positive team environment.
